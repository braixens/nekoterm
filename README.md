# nekoterm 🐾


A simple tui that can play blackjack (MORE GAMES SOON..) Built with Rust and powered by [`ratatui`](https://crates.io/crates/ratatui).

Currently, you can play with yourself, and a dealer. It's fast, minimal, and runs right inside your terminal window.

## 🃏 Current Game: silly kitty blackjack

- Shuffly, dealy, and fluffy gameplay
- Easy Controls: use `H` to hit, `S` to stand, `Q` to quit, and `R` to restart when you win! (OR LOSE xD)
- Designed with love I promise
